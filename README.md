# Stars-and-bars-with-restrictions

Given equations of the type x1 + x2 + x3 + ... + xn = k

where all x1, x2, ..., xn are variables with possible restrictions, and k is a known value

Counts the amount of possible solutions to the equation

There are known polynomials to answer this question, but i'm electing to use basic counting principals including the stars and bars method and the inclusion-exclusion principal.
